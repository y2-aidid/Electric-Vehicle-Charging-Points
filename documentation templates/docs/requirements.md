# Requirements

## User Needs

### User stories
TODO: 

    As a EV user, I want to find the nearest charging point that is full, as it will save some of my leletric from being wasted of travelling to the furthest electric charging point that is empty and having to travel around to find a full charging point.

    As the council, I want to check all charging points on the app to gather data as it will show if they are beeing used or if we need more charging points so that fidning a EV charging point for EV users will not be difficult by making sure that there is enough charging points. Without the app, we would not know wether we need new charging points or not and if we did not bring new extra charging points, EV users will struggle to find available charging points.

    As the user who recharges the charging point, I want to make sure that all charging point is full by checking the app which point has ran out off charger, so I can recharger that point allowing a EV users to have access to a full charging point. Without this, I will struggle to find charging point with no charger left making less charging points available for users.

### Actors
TODO: List and describe the actors/users for this product.
User 1 - A Electric Vehicle user who needs access to a charging point.
User 2 - A Bristol City Coucncil member who needs access to the app for data.
User 3 - A Worker who changes the empty battery to a full battery by using the app to identify which charging point is empty.

### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (at least one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

## Software Requirements Specification
### Functional requirements
 
The System should show a clear marking for all the ev ports on the map

The system should require access to the users location

They system should show the availibilty on the ports that the user is looking at

The system should show the price of how much it cost to charge the vehicle

### Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: The app should quickly respond to the user when used (performance efficiency) 

NFR2: The app should clearly show all the points with suitable sized marking (usability)

NFR3: The app should be usable on chrome internet browsers (compatibillity)

NFR4: The app should have a suitable default location if there is no location provided by the user (reliability)

NFR5: The app should be update to make sure there are working ev ports on all the marked locations on the app (functional suitability)

NFR6: The app should respond to the users request in quick timing (performance efficiency)

NFR7: The app should be able to be used on mobile as well as other devices (portability)

NFR8:The app should should keep users safe just incase they get into a accident this can reported easily.eg time and place (security)

NFR9:The app should maintain frequent updates for users to see once they open the app like available pumps (maintainability)
