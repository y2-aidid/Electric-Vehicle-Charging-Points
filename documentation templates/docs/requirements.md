## User Needs

### User stories
TODO: 

    As a EV user, I want to find the nearest charging point that is full, as it will save some of my leletric from being wasted of travelling to the furthest electric charging point that is empty and having to travel around to find a full charging point.

    As the council, I want to check all charging points on the app to gather data as it will show if they are beeing used or if we need more charging points so that fidning a EV charging point for EV users will not be difficult by making sure that there is enough charging points. Without the app, we would not know wether we need new charging points or not and if we did not bring new extra charging points, EV users will struggle to find available charging points.

    As the user who recharges the charging point, I want to make sure that all charging point is full by checking the app which point has ran out off charger, so I can recharger that point allowing a EV users to have access to a full charging point. Without this, I will struggle to find charging point with no charger left making less charging points available for users.

### Actors
TODO: List and describe the actors/users for this product.
User 1 - A Electric Vehicle user who needs access to a charging point.
User 2 - A Bristol City Coucncil member who needs access to the app for data.
User 3 - A Worker who changes the empty battery to a full battery by using the app to identify which charging point is empty.

### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (at least one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

## Software Requirements Specification
### Functional requirements
TODO: create a list of functional requirements. 
    e.g. "The system shall ..."
    Give each functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. FR1, FR2, ...
    Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.


### Non-Functional Requirements
TODO: Consider one or more [quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126) to suggest a small number of non-functional requirements.
Give each non-functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. NFR1, NFR2, ...

Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.
