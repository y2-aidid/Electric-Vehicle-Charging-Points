# Project Proposal

## Business Case 
This page is our business case for Electric Vehicle Charging Points which will help and support users allocate the right, perfect and suitable charging point with our app. By making sure they are able to allocate the right, perfect and suitable charging point, we will create a plan with a problem statement, business benefit, options considered, expected risk and project scope. This plan will help me identify anything which I or my partners have missed out. This is important as without a plan, we will go through a lot off issues and problems which could lead to our app being not usefull to our users.

### Problem statement
 A problem statement is a statment of porblems which have been identified by me or my partners. This is a big thing to do while planning as not identifing problems could later lead the problem occuring which we may not be able to deal with properly as identifying problems inadvance will prepare us.
The Electric Vehicle Charging point project is aim to help electric vehicle users allocate a charging point for the Vehicle. As Electric Vehicle is becomming more and more used and that by 2030 all new vehicles made must be electric, I belive that our app will support and benefit a lot of electric vehicle users to allocate charging points as all vechile users in the future will be using charging point where this app will benefit them a lot from saving time, money and battery when finding a charging point.

### Business benefits
Identifying business benefits during planning is important as it will help us identify what we need to do to meet succes or growth or be sustainable.
 First beenfit is to allow users to identify the closest charging points, allow users to idenitfy if the charging point can charger their vehicle, allow users to identify which EV charging point is full or not, allow them to identify if they have to pay for the charging point, allow users to plan their journey inadvance with the EV charging points from using our app. 
      
      

### Options Considered
During planning, we need to consider options for our users as it is vital. This is becausewithout considering any options during planning, we won't be able to meet their standards meaning this app won't be very usefull as it doesn't really help them identify electric vechile charging points.
One option We have considered is ' What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?'. This is important as later on we know have to identify options with a EV charging point for our users.

Another option We have considered is 'Does the EV charging point charger all vehicle?'. This is also important that we have considered this option as we now have to check what types of EV charging point for our users and how will we let them know if it is compatible for the vechile because if we also fail to identify this, users will struggle to find the right charging point.

Another option We have considered is 'Is the charging point full?'. This is also a  important option as users need to be able to find the right full charging point as without helping them identify which charging point is full, they will struggle to find one making the app usless.

Another option We have considered is 'Will the charging point charge money?'. This is a vital option to consider as some EV may be free and some may not be. EV users consider this option so they a prepared to pay if required. 

Another option We have considered is 'Is the charger applicaple for the vechile?' This is a vital option to consider as users need to be able to find a compatible charging point for their vechile.

Another option We have considered is 'Is all charging spot available?'. All EV users consider this as they need a available charging point as if they turn up to a location with EV charging points all beeing used, they have to go to another location as cahrging a EV takes time meaning all users at that location may not be able to sacrifice their spot for the user looking for a avaiable spot.

Another option We have considered is 'Can they book through the app?'. EV users may also consider this as they want to have a reserved spot. This is because, most spots may not be avaible to be used so them booking through a app will help them plan ahead by bookinb a spot.
      

### Expected Risks
 What are the main risks of this project?
  Risk is  important to plan as it will help us identify any risk that we are exposed to making us more prepared as we will be aware and know how to deal with out.
Users may fail to identify charging points as once everyone discovers this app, people will struggle to allocate and access charging points. This means that the council will have to make more charging points for the public to access. Another thiing is EV is time consumming as it take time to charger meaning people may charger at their own home. Another risk is virus, as our app is vulnerable to all tyes of virus which could mislead or expose users details or stop our app from working.
