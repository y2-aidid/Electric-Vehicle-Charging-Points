# Implementation

## Introduction
The implementation to use the electricle vehicle charging ports were made by using bristol open data. using this data helps us capitilize on all information needed to make iit as easy as possible for us. This data mentions the exact location, the manufacturer and weather it is in a public car park. The dataset made availaible is very accurate and reliable but is also capable of making mistakes and having inacurate information.   

## Project Structure
index.html is the code that conntains the data to access the website
map.html allows access to see the area we are working within and shows the local electric vehicle charging ports
style.ccs acts as the file that shows how the set will look when being accessed
