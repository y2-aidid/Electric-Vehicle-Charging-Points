# Design

## User Interface design
This here is our wireframes that we created.This shows how users will be able to access this. We have implemented drop downs as this makes it more user friendly and easier for users to get to where they want without much difficuty.This has a map so that if they do need the charging then they will be able to see where it is efficiently.We have also put in what type of ev charging they can find since not every car will have the same type this makes it helpful so the users can get straight to the right one.Theres also ev prices we have implemented so users know how much the prices are before they go. we have did this because the users can check the price and see which ones are cheaper to save money.Theres also a report option this is here because users will be able to report if something goes wrong eg. the charger not working,Too many cars waiting,This will allow for problems to get sorted out for the fututre and help make things run smoothly.
