# Testing

## Test Plan
This is our testing for which we will carry out a test of how well this runs. Testing helps us identify what is going to go wrong and how we will be able to fix it. This is called risk mitigation. It is normally cheaper to correct defects in the software early in the development process than to do it later in the life cycle or after deployment. Testing, therefore, cuts down on the cost of software development since it saves on costly fixes after deployment and costly reworks in the software development process. It ensures that the software complies with the standards and regulations set in industrial requirements, more so in industries with very strict compliance requirements, such as health, finance, and aviation. Testing gives quality feedback to software developers and stakeholders. It allows teams to trace and track points of improvement in the software development process, hence optimization in time based on the outcome of the test and metric analysis. Testing also allows us to identify any issues our users will come across before allowing them to use the app. Failling to do this will mean that all the hard work and effort will go to waste as our app won't be really usefull.

We wll test the app to make sure it works perfectly; as we need to make sure it works smoothly and fast. If we fail to have a smoothly running app with no issues and fail to identify any problems, the users will struggle to interact with the app.
To make sure we deal with this swiftly, we will test:

Running the app - The app should run smoothly with no lag. If it fails to run we will solve the issue by checking the coding. 
Functional home screen - We will make sure the buttons on the home screen are working so the users can interact with the app. For example, if I press the buttons on the home screen and it fails, we will solve the issue as the app will not interact with the usser.
Clear Map - We should have a map that shows the user where they can find EV charging points as without this, the app will not be usefull to them as the map will contain a image or something with a detailed box around each location adress showing the user what EV Point is available.
Search Bar - The search bar must work for the user as it will help them save time to search the locations they need. Without this, we will struggle to meet the customers satisfaction. 
Table conatining List of Data About EV - We must make sure that when testing, a list of available charging point along with adress, enough charging slot and etc. Without this, our app is failed. This is because, the users need it to help them with their needs: which are finding a ev charging point adress, available parking spot, if the ev charging point is working and etc.

If we experience a failed test, that will mean that our app is not fully functionable for our users need.

TODO: For each test described above, indicate the current status. 
Create a requirements traceability matrix to validate the completeness of the product.
