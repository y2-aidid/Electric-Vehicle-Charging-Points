# Testing

## Test Plan
This is our testing in this we will conduct a test to see how well this runs.Testing allows us to identify what will go wrong and how we will be able to fix it.This is called risk mitigtion.It is normally less expensive to correct software bugs early in the development process than later in the lifecycle or after deployment. Testing decreases the general cost of software development as it saves costly fixes after deployment and prevents expensive reworks.It ensures software compliance with industrial standards, regulations, and requirements, more so in these industries that have very strict compliance requirementsâ€”say, healthcare, finance, and aviation. Testing is a means of obtaining feedback on software quality to developers and stakeholders.Based on the test outcomes and metrics analysis, teams can trace and track points of improvement in the development process and optimize it over time.

Test Runs
TODO: For each test described above, indicate the current status. 
Create a requirements traceability matrix to validate the completeness of the product.

| Use-Case ID | Requirement ID | Test Case | Status |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------- | yo     |

TODO: Add rows for each test, current status is eg. pass/fail
